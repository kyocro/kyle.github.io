# Kyle's Cybersecurity Portfolio

## Professional Statement

As a Bilingual Scotiabank IT Analyst (lvl.5), I am excited to share my skills and knowledge with the dynamic field of cybersecurity. My passion for cybersecurity compliance, network security, and threat intelligence began with my first Helpdesk role at Asurion where I worked as a Computer Helpdesk Technician and first realized I could interact with with firewall technology and use this firewall software to block specific ports and programs from communicating with a client's device while going through a standard Command Prompt SFC/scan in a previous case.

 I am excited about the prospect of securing digital environments against emerging threats and am hoping that my experience in IT as well as the Google Cybersecurity Certificate I am currently working on will help me land an entry level role in the Cybersecurity field!
